# SLB

**SLB** or otherwise known as **Server List Browser** is a extension that implements SLS into Google Chrome and made using JavaScript by PizzaCrust.

## Features

- Lists servers on the specified repository
- Repository can be configurated
- You can join games directly from the listings

### Tutorial

I have created this tutorial for chrome dummies. Since, I cannot publish it to the chrome web store, I can only give you the source and for you to load it as a unpacked extension. You must manual retrieve a new extension source every update.

Requirements:
- You need Git and it must be in your enviromental path
- You need Chrome
- You need to trust me

1. Clone the Git repository
2. Go to **chrome://extensions**
3. Tick developer mode
4. Click **Load unpacked extension**. *Note: I do not suggest you install any other unpacked extension, it may be dangerous. You can see the source of this extension, to see if you can trust it.*
5. Select the Git Repository's Directory
Done! You may want to change the repository settings. Press the S icon on your tray, and click options. You can configure the extension from there.
